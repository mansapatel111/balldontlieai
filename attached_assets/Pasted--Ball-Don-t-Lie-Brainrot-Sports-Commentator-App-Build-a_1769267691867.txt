# Ball Don't Lie - Brainrot Sports Commentator App

Build a next-gen web app that transforms any video into hilarious, high-energy brainrot commentary with a cutting-edge UI inspired by 21st.dev aesthetics.

## Core Features

### Video Input System

- Sleek video selector with:

  - Preloaded highlight videos (basketball, soccer, gaming clips)

  - YouTube URL paste input with real-time preview

### Vibe Selector

Create a stunning carousel or card selector for commentary styles:

- **Rizz Lord** - charismatic, meme-heavy, Ohio-coded

- **Sigma Grindset** - motivational, hustle culture, based takes

- **Zoomer Chaos** - unhinged, ADHD energy, max brainrot

- **NPC Energy** - oblivious, repetitive, background character vibes

- **Giga Chad** - dominant, assertive, peak masculinity commentary

### Live Commentary Engine

- Real-time video player with:

  - Waveform visualization synced to generated audio

  - Live transcript display showing original → brainrot transformation

  - Commentary buffer indicator

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack

- next js, tsx 

- Framer Motion for animations

- Video.js or similar for player

- Web Audio API for audio visualization

### Backend Processing

1. **Transcription**: Use Whisper API or similar to generate timestamped transcript

2. **AI Commentary**: Stream transcript chunks to Gemini/LLaMA with vibe-specific system prompts

3. **TTS Pipeline**: Send generated commentary to ElevenLabs in real-time

4. **Audio Sync**: Layer TTS output over original video with precise timing

## UI Design Requirements (21st.dev inspired)

### Visual Style - use shader animation specifically from this: https://21st.dev/community/components/aliimam/shader-animation/default

- Dark mode with vibrant accent colors (neon purple, electric blue, acid green)

- Glassmorphism effects on cards and panels

- Smooth gradient backgrounds with animated noise/grain texture

- Micro-interactions on every button and input

- Satisfying hover states with scale/glow effects

### Layout Components

- Full-screen video player with minimal chrome

- Floating control panel with backdrop blur

- Smooth page transitions between upload → selection → playback

- Mobile-responsive with touch-optimized controls

### Animations

- Page load: Staggered fade-in of elements

- Video selection: Smooth zoom transitions

- Vibe cards: 3D tilt effect on hover

- Commentary generation: Pulse/ripple effects showing AI activity

- Audio visualization: Dynamic frequency bars

### Typography

- Bold, modern sans-serif (Inter, Satoshi, or similar)

- Large, impactful headings

- Subtle text shadows for depth

- Animated gradient text for "BALL DON'T LIE" logo

## Key User Interactions

1. **Landing**: Explosive hero section with animated logo, "Start Rotting" CTA button

2. **Upload Flow**: Drag zone expands with spring animation, progress bars with particle effects

3. **Vibe Selection**: Cards flip/reveal on selection, haptic feedback simulation

4. **Playback**: Commentary chunks appear with typewriter effect, audio bars dance to voice

## Implementation Notes

- Use WebSocket or Server-Sent Events for real-time commentary streaming

- Implement audio buffering to prevent gaps between TTS chunks

- Cache generated commentary for replay functionality

- Add "Share Clip" feature with 15-second highlight exports

- Include volume mixer for balancing original audio vs commentary

## Stretch Goals

- Multi-language support for maximum international brainrot

- User-created custom vibes with prompt templates

- Leaderboard of most-used videos/vibes

- Social sharing with auto-generated meme thumbnails

- Live streaming mode for real-time event commentary

Build this with maximum swagger - every interaction should feel premium, responsive, and slightly unhinged. The UI should match the chaotic energy of the commentary itself.
