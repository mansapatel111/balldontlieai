    transcription: "The biggest and brightest stage awaits. Welcome to Miami and the College Football Playoff National Championship presented by AT&T. Think he would attempt any long distance field goals that Signetti elects to try tonight. Well, check that. He boots it to the one yard line and a chance for a return and Marian breaks through one tackle. He'll be stopped at about the 27 yard line. See what the Hoosiers do to adjust. Quick throw across the middle. Catch made and running after it is Cooper. Cooper breaking tackles out across the 45 yards after the catch. 4 yards.Indiana at the quarterback leading a little bit. Draws first blood in this game. The Hoosiers 12 play drive and long. Pressure comes. Back going to be racked up and sacked by Aiden Fischer, the captain, an emotional leader of this Indiana defense. And the Hoosiers are flexing. They hand it off to the fullback/tight end. And he powers in. Touchdown Indiana. A dominant start here for the number one team."

Messi's legacy is complete. The entire country erupts. This is what dreams are made of!"
